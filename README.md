## `Overview of the Cryptocurrencies Analysis`

The purpose for the project is to prepare an analysis for the clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. Also, as there is no known output it needs to
process data, to cluster it, to reduce the dimensions, and to reduce the principal components by using unsupervised learning.

The analysis consists of four technical analysis deliverables as the following: 

- Preprocessing the Data for PCA;
- Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA;
- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means;
- Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results.

## `Resources`	
The analysis is created using next software: Jupyter-notebook 6.3.0, Python 3.8.8, Pandas 1.2.4, machine learning libraries for Python: StandardScaler, Visual Studio Code 1.58.0.

### `- Preprocessing the Data for PCA`	

Upreprocess the dataset in order to perform PCA in Deliverable 2.

The result of Preprocessing the Data for PCA can be found in the [Credit_Risk_Resampling](./credit_risk_resampling.ipynb) file.

According the results of
